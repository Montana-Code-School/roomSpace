#roomSpace

RoomSpace is a program built to count the number of people entering and exiting a venue. Using a video source, such as a Raspberry Pi, set up over a doorway, we collect data every time a person enters/exits and send it to a CSV. This CSV is then taken into our d3.js code to create different data visualizations.
